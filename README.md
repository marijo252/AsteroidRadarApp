# Asteroid radar app
This project is the second android project I created with the Udacity Android nanodegree program and consited in creating and app to view the asteroids detected by NASA that pass near Earth. To complete the app, I apply skills such as fetching data from the internet, saving data to a database, and display the data in a clear, compelling UI.

## Concept
This is a more complete application which required the added knowledge learned from the Udacity program, such concepts were:

1. Retrofit library to download the data from the Internet.
2. Moshi to convert the JSON data we are downloading to usable data in the form of custom classes.
3. Glide library to download an cache images.
4. RecyclerView to display the asteroids in a list.
5. MVVM pattern
6. Live data
7. Navigation
8. Room
